Welcome to my food blog website. This blog is designed to explore the benefits of using an electric pressure cooker on your diet, health and lifestyle.


# Aims
* Users should arrive on the page and understand exactly what the blog is about
 * Knowledge and exposure to the type of appliance and cooking that this blog will cover is narrow
 * Home page should immediately clarify what the blog is about as well as the main benefits, the user can then explore the benefits in greater detail and the recipes
* Website is designed mobile-first and should respond to changes in screen size
* Recipes will come in 'weekly plans' so users can buy all ingredients in advance - saving time and money.
